## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture and Workflow

TradeView is built on a modern, scalable architecture designed for high performance and real-time data delivery.

### Overall Architecture

  * **Frontend**: A responsive and interactive UI built with **Next.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn** components. The animations are powered by **Framer Motion** and **Three.js**.
  * **Backend**: Server-side logic is efficiently handled by **Next.js API Routes**.
  * **Database**: **MongoDB** serves as the primary database, storing user data, transactions, holdings, and watchlists.
  * **Caching**: **Redis** is implemented as a high-speed in-memory cache to store frequently accessed data like stock and crypto prices, significantly reducing database load and improving response times.
  * **Authentication**: **Next-Auth** provides a robust and secure authentication system, supporting both OAuth (Google, GitHub) and credentials-based login.
  * **Real-time Data**: A combination of **Finnhub**, **Polygon.io**, **CoinGecko**, and **Yahoo Finance** APIs provide live and historical market data.
  * **Payment Processing**: **Razorpay** and **PayU** are used for deposits, and **Cashfree** is used for withdrawals.
  * **Automation**: A **cron job** runs daily to automate the process of fetching and updating stock and cryptocurrency prices.

### Website Workflow

1.  **User Authentication**: The user signs up or logs in via Google, GitHub, or email. Their session is securely managed by **Next-Auth**, and a user profile is created in **MongoDB**.
2.  **Data Fetching & Caching**:
      * When a user requests data for a stock or cryptocurrency for the first time, the system fetches it from the respective API (**Polygon.io**, **Finnhub**, **CoinGecko**, or **Yahoo Finance**).
      * This data is then stored in the **MongoDB** database for historical reference.
      * The most recent and frequently accessed price data is also pushed to the **Redis cache**.
      * Subsequent requests for the same data are served directly from **Redis**, ensuring near-instant load times.
3.  **Automated Daily Price Updates**:
      * A **cron job** is scheduled to run at the end of each trading day.
      * This job systematically fetches the closing prices and other relevant data for all tracked stocks and cryptocurrencies.
      * It updates the **MongoDB** database with this new information and refreshes the **Redis cache** to ensure the data is current for the next trading session.
4.  **Real-time Trading Interface**:
      * When a user views a trading chart, historical data is loaded from the **Redis cache** or **MongoDB**.
      * A WebSocket connection is established with **Finnhub** to stream live price updates, which are reflected on the chart in real-time.
5.  **Placing an Order**:
      * The user places a buy or sell order.
      * The system verifies the user's wallet balance and holdings.
      * The order is recorded in the **MongoDB** database.
      * Once the order is executed, the user's **holdings** and **wallet** are updated accordingly.
6.  **News, Watchlists, and Alerts**:
      * The **Finnhub API** is used to fetch live news, which is displayed on the dashboard.
      * Users can add stocks and cryptocurrencies to their **watchlist**, which is stored in **MongoDB**. The watchlist data is then fetched and displayed in real-time.
      * The system continuously monitors the prices of assets in the user's alerts list and sends a notification when a target price is met.

### Performance and Analytics

  * **Performance**: The combination of **Next.js** for server-side rendering, **Redis** for caching, and efficient database queries ensures a fast and responsive user experience.
  * **Analytics**: The platform is designed to support future integration with analytics tools. By analyzing order and transaction data in **MongoDB**, you can generate insights into user trading patterns, popular assets, and overall platform activity.
